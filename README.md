# Haskell Tools and Frameworks

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

[Code Server](https://coder.com/) is a tool that allows you to run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.

[Haskell for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell) is an extension adds language support for Haskell, powered by the [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server).

[Haskell Dockerfile Linter](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) is a smarter Dockerfile linter that helps you build [best practice](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices) Docker images.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) is a shell script static analysis tool.

[Haskelly](https://github.com/haskelly-dev/Haskelly) is a VS Code extension that provides complete support for casual and expert Haskell development.

[Miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) is a small, production-ready, Haskell front-end framework for quickly building highly interactive single-page web applications. It features a virtual-dom, recursive diffing / patching algorithm, attribute and property normalization, event delegation, event batching, SVG, Server-sent events, Websockets, type-safe [servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/)-style routing and an extensible Subscription-based subsystem.

[Grenade](https://github.com/HuwCampbell/grenade) is a composable, dependently typed, and fast recurrent neural network library for Machine Learning in Haskell.

[IntelliJ Haskell](https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell) is an IntelliJ plugin for Haskell.

[Ghci](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/GHCi) is a  powerful and extensible debugger for GHC.

[Hugs](https://www.haskell.org/hugs/) is a haskell interpreter that includes debugging facilities.

[HLint](https://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/) is a tool that detects common style mistakes and redundant parts of syntax, improving code quality.

[Sourcegraph](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SourceGraph-0.5.5.0) is a Haskell visualizer tool.

[QuickCheck](https://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/) is a  powerful testing framework where test cases are generated according to specific properties.

[HUnit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit-1.2.2.1) is a tool for unit testing framework similar to JUnit.

[microspec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microspec) is  a tiny QuickCheck test library with minimal dependencies.

[Hspec](https://hspec.github.io/) is a testing framework similar to RSpec with support for QuickCheck and HUnit.

[The Haskell Test Framework (HTF)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HTF) is a tool that integrates both Hunit and QuickCheck.

[Threadscope](https://code.haskell.org/ThreadScope/) is a new feature on the horizon which allows for benchmarking and visualization of multithreaded performance.
ghc profiling tools - a powerful suite of profiling tools exist within GHC itself.

[Haddock](https://www.haskell.org/haddock/) is a documentation system for Haskell.

[CodeWorld](https://github.com/google/codeworld) is an educational environment using Haskell. It provides a simple mathematical model for geometric figures, animations, and interactive and multi-player games.
